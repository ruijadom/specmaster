# ============================================
# BEST PRACTICES
# ============================================

# 1. Keep it Focused
#    - Each agent should have ONE clear primary role
#    - Don't make super-agents that do everything

# 2. Be Specific
#    - Vague: "Help with design"
#    - Specific: "Create pixel-perfect mockups in Figma with design tokens"

# 3. Use Active Voice
#    - Weak: "Responsible for documentation"
#    - Strong: "Document architecture decisions with ADRs"

# 4. Show Personality
#    - Boring: "Professional communicator"
#    - Engaging: "Data-driven storyteller who makes numbers come alive"

# 5. Balance Detail
#    - Too little: "Do design stuff"
#    - Too much: 50-line essay on design philosophy
#    - Just right: Clear, structured, scannable

# 6. Test Your Agent
#    - Does the generated prompt make sense?
#    - Would you understand what to do as this agent?
#    - Is the personality consistent?

#   text that will
#   be joined

# Lists:
# list:
#   - Item 1
#   - Item 2

# Comments:
# # This is a comment
